Data used in experiments described in the paper "USING EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING TO DETECT GLOTTAL CLOSURE INSTANTS IN SPEECH SIGNAL".

An example of a Python code to train and test an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier used to detect glottal closure instants (GCIs), including a brief data and classification procedure description, is shown in [`GCI_detection.html`](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ARTIC-TTS-experiments/2019-ICASSP/blob/master/GCI_detection.html). The corresponding interactive Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the iPython notebook) is available in `GCI_detection.ipynb`. Please see the [official page](http://jupyter.org/) for an information on how to launch the jupyter notebook.
